Hi!

1. Just like I mentioned in [Something about me](/_posts/2022-11-22-something-about-me.md) post, I believe other people also thinks that their ideas are gem and the truth. It is imperative, therefore, for me to understand that people truly believe in what they say and believe that their thoughts/approach is better for the society and will make world a better place.

    This means that I must approach discussions and disagreements with an open mind and a willingness to listen and understand their perspective. It's essential to engage in constructive dialogue, share ideas, and find common ground whenever possible. Even if I may not always agree with someone's point of view, respecting their right to hold those beliefs and fostering a sense of empathy can lead to more meaningful and productive conversations.
