Here I will write about my habits that I consider not being in a harmony with me and the steps that I shall take to understand it better by acceptance and with the hope of working on it.

## My habits

1. I have a tendency to argue with people with different opinion than mine. Sometimes I argue with facts, and othertimes, with belief extrapolated by the induction of logic and also at times with pure emotion. Whatever the approach is, I argue and that seems to be my habit. 
> I am trying to snap of it whenever I become aware of it. I will work on asking people what they think about rather that telling them what I think, or telling what I think and ask what they think about what I think.

2. I often tell people when I think (not knowing for sure, just think) they are wrong and I go deep into that thinking that if I explain the nuances, it will be clear. However, I have come to understand that the nuances sometimes might just feel like I am taking it too deep and making a big deal out of it.
> I understand that people need time to think to process it wholly. So, I am working on finding a sweet spot to leave the conversation where it is not wanting to conclude or have an agreement. Basically, being mindful about the impasses, recognizing them and agreeing to disagree.
